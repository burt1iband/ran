***RAN***
This README file is for ran; part of the fluxability project.
RAN is a simple frontend to sox for recording of audio notes and quick klipz written in bash, formerlly known as rn.
Although ran can be run as a stand alone bash script it tries to read fluxable.conf to set some defaults.

The directory where you found this README should also contain the following files.

change-log.txt
fluxable.conf  
install_ran.sh
md5sums.txt
ran
ran.1.gz

**Installation
Extract files from the ran tarball with something like
tar xjf ran-<version>.tar.bz2
replacing version with the actual version number of your package.
Change in to the newly created directory with cd, e.g.
cd Downloads/ran-<version>
assuming you extracted the tarball in a sub-directory of your home folder called Downloads
and againreplacing <version> with the version number of your package.
Now type 
sudo ./install_ran.sh
You will be prompted for your password, and once it is correctly entered 
the ran installer will start.
Many users will already have sox on their systems, 
and for them installation should be almost instant.

**Usage
The whole point of ran is simplicity and ease of use.
Typing ran Jeff will start recording a file called Jeff.ogg in ~/Audio/au_notes.
If you don't enter your file's basename on the command line then 
the recording is named ran.ogg.
Existing files are renamed with a timestamp, or if the -a flag is used
they are appended to. Control c stops a recording.
To see all available options and configurations see the ran manp page,
and ran -h will show you the basics.
